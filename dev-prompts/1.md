Please help me to develop a Streamlit application. Here are the functionalities that I would like to have included. 

The user has the ability to provide their API key. We can use Open AI for the large language model. It's a question and answer format in the main window. The large language model will ask the user a completely random questions one at a time. The user then has to provide an answer into a answer pane on the right of the screen. If possible, there be a microphone icon so that the user can use their system microphone to do voice typing to speed up the process. They can use the built in voice to text stuff in Google Chrome. 

Then there's a button that says end interview. When that button is hit, the interview is concluded and all the foregoing conversation history between the large language model agent and the user is written to a file. 

That file then needs to be processed and the contextual data that it contains should be extracted. The logic should be something like the following. The large language model should analyze the entire chat transcript and attempt to pick out as many facts about the user as it can identify. 

From this transcript it should create a context data snippet. The contact data snippet contains a list of all the data points and information about the user that were extracted from the transcript. The context data snippet should be written in natural language and in the 3rd person describing the user as the user. 

Once the contact snippet has been generated, it should be displayed in a final text window, perhaps beneath the other ones. The user can then either copy it out as markdown using a copy functionality or they can download it as a generated markdown file. It's important that the contextual snippet should aggregate similar information under similar headings. Markdown can be used for headings and to write out the context data. 

Finally, there should be a clear button in which the user can begin the process again. All fields can return to null and the user can begin another set of questions and answers with the bot. The objective of this program is to provide an interface for the user to proactively develop contextual data for use with large language models. 

The first agent in this chain, the interviewing agent, should be instructed to ask the user wide ranging and random questions that are likely to yield context data for this purpose
